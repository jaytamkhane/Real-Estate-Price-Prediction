# 🏘️ Real Estate Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict real estate prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more. The goal is to provide accurate property price estimates to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making data-driven decisions.

## 📌 Real Estate Price Prediction: Process We Can Follow

Below is the process we can follow for real estate price prediction to help individuals and businesses make informed decisions in the real estate market:

1. **Gather Data**: Collect relevant data from various sources, including real estate databases, government records, online listings, and other public or private sources.
2. **Clean and Prepare Data**: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to capture important information that can influence real estate prices.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore and visualize the data to gain insights into its distribution, correlations, and patterns.
5. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms or predictive models for the task.
6. **Model Training**: Train the selected model on the training data, optimizing its parameters to make accurate predictions.
